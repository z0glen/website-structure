			<p>
				I'm a fourth year student at Northeastern University, studying bioengineering
				and computer science. I'm looking to get involved with projects that
				combine those two worlds; I think that the intersection of science and
				software has the potential to help people, and I want to be a part of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also have a background in affective sciences and cognitive research,
				which means that I have spent considerable time designing and implementing
				experiments for cognitive assessment, as well as experience sampling.
				The brain is an amazing thing, and I believe that cognitive science is an important
				and exciting area of research because having a better understanding of how we think will help us
				understand how to be our best selves and how to maintain a healthy mind.
				Two things we could all use these days.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not in class or in the lab, I'm often competing at hackathons,
				learning about new programming languages or techniques, or watching The Office.
				I also compose music, help out with theater productions, and travel.
